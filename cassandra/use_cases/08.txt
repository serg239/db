Replacing a Single Running Node of an existing Cassandra Cluster
================================================================

Description
-----------
Steps to replace a Running Node with a New Node, such as when updating 
to newer hardware or performing proactive maintenance.
User replaces a Single Running Node in the existing Cassandra Database Cluster 
by using a Salt state script or predefined scenario (manually).

Assumptions
-----------
1. The Running Node is not the last Node in the Cluster.

Pre-conditions
--------------
1. The Replacement Node is prepared, integrated into the Cluster, and started.
2. The IP address of the running Node (<ip_address_of_running_node>) 
   is defined in the "replace_running_node" pillar.

Post-conditions
---------------
1. The Running Node is replaced with a New Node.

Main Success Scenario
---------------------
1. User runs the replace_running_node.sls Salt state script.
2. System stops the cassandra process on Running Node. 
3. System updates the cassandra-topology.properties configuration file 
   on the Replacement Node.
4. System updates the cassandra.yaml configuration file 
   on the Replacement Node.
5. System starts the Cassandra process on the Replacement Node 
   and wait 2 min.
6. System runs the "cleanup" job on EACH of the previously existing Nodes 
   to remove the keys no longer belonging to those Nodes.

Extensions
----------
1. The Salt state script has not started:
1.1. Check if salt-minion process has been started on the Running 
     and Replacement Nodes.
