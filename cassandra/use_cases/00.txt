Notes
-----

Seed Nodes serve two purposes:

1. They act as a place for new Nodes to announce themselves to a Cluster. 
So, without at least one live Seed Node, no new Nodes can join the Cluster 
because they have no idea how to contact Non-Seed Nodes to get the Cluster
status.

2. Seed nodes act as GOSSIP hot spots. 
Since Nodes GOSSIP more often with Seeds than Non-Seeds, the Seeds tend 
to have more current information, and therefore the whole Cluster has more 
current information. This is the reason you are instructed to not make 
all nodes Seeds. Similarly, this is also why all Nodes in a given Data 
Center should have the same list of Seed Nodes in their cassandra.yaml file. 
Typically, 3 seed nodes per data center is ideal.
(see http://wiki.apache.org/cassandra/ArchitectureGossip)

3. The rack and datacenter for the local Node are defined in the 
cassandra-rackdc.properties file and propagated to other nodes via GOSSIP.
