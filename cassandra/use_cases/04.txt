Deployment of a Single Regular Node to an existing Cassandra Cluster
====================================================================

Description
-----------
User adds a Single Regular Node to the existing Cassandra Database Cluster 
by using a Salt state script or predefined scenario (manually).

Assumptions
-----------
1. The cassandra process on the new Regular Node is stopped.

Pre-conditions
--------------
1. The Roles of Regular Node in the Cassandra Cluster are defined as Grains on the Regular Node.

2. The IP address of Regular Node is defined in the "add_node" Pillar.

Post-conditions
---------------
1. The new Regular Node has been added to the Cassandra Cluster.
2. The data in the Cassandra Cluster has been redistributed between ALL Nodes.

Main Success Scenario
---------------------
1. User runs the add_node.sls Salt state script.
2. System updates the cassandra-topology.properties configuration file 
   on the new Regular Node.
3. System updates the cassandra.yaml configuration file 
   on the new Regular Node.
4. System starts the Cassandra process on the new Regular Node 
   and wait 2 min.
5. System runs the "cleanup" job on EACH of the previously existing Nodes 
   to remove the keys no longer belonging to those Nodes.

Extensions
----------
1. The Salt state script has not started:
1.1. Check if salt-minion process has been started on the Regular Node.

2. The cassandra process has not started:
2.1. Check if cassandra.yaml and cassandra-topology.properties configuration 
     files has been updated.
2.2. Check the Log files.
