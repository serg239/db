Replacing a Single Dead Node of an existing Cassandra Cluster
=============================================================

Description
-----------
Steps to replace a Node that has died for some reason, such as hardware failure.
User replaces a Single Dead Node in the existing Cassandra Database Cluster 
by using a Salt state script or predefined scenario (manually).

Assumptions
-----------
1. The Dead Node is not the last Node in the Cluster.
2. The nodetool command shows a down status for the Dead Node (DN).

Pre-conditions
--------------
1. The Replacement Node is prepared, configured, but not started.
2. The IP address of the Dead Node (<ip_address_of_dead_node>) is defined in the 
   "replace_dead_node" Pillar.

Post-conditions
---------------
1. The Dead Node is replaced with a New Node.

Main Success Scenario
---------------------
1. User runs the replace_dead_node.sls Salt state script.
2. System adds the following option to the cassandra-env.sh file:
  JVM_OPTS="$JVM_OPTS -Dcassandra.replace_address=<ip_address_of_dead_node>"
3. System starts the Replacement Node with new replace_address option.
4. System removed the added option (after the New Node finishes bootstrapping) 
   from cassandra-env.sh file.

Extensions
-----------
1. The Salt state script has not started:
1.1. Check if salt-minion process has been started on the Replacement Node.

2. The Cassandra has not started:
2.1. Start the service manually:

  $ sudo service cassandra start

2.2. Check the Log files.
