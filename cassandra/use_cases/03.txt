Deployment of a Single Seed Node to existing Cassandra Cluster
==============================================================

Description
-----------
User adds a Single Seed Node to the existing Cassandra Database Cluster by using 
a Salt state script or predefined scenario (manually).

Assumptions
-----------
1. The cassandra process on the new Seed Node is stopped.

Pre-conditions
--------------
1. The Roles of Seed Node in the Cassandra Cluster are defined as Grains on the Seed Node.
2. The IP address of Seed Node is defined in the "add_node" Pillar.

Post-conditions
---------------
1. The new Seed Node has been added to the Cassandra Cluster.
2. The data in the Cassandra Cluster has been redistributed between all Nodes.

Main Success Scenario
---------------------
1. User runs the add_node.sls Salt state script.
2. System updates the cassandra-topology.properties configuration file 
   on the new Seed Node.
3. System updates the cassandra.yaml configuration file on the new Seed Node 
   and ALL previously existing Nodes.
4. System starts the cassandra process on the new Seed Node.
5. System runs the "cleanup" job on EACH of the previously existing Nodes 
   to remove the keys no longer belonging to those Nodes.

Extensions
----------
1. The Salt state script has not started:
1.1. Check if salt-minion process has been started on the Seed Node.

2.1. The cassandra process has not started:
2.1. Check if cassandra.yaml and cassandra-topology.properties configuration 
     files has been updated.
2.2. Check the Log files.

Notes
-----
The seeds list property in the cassandra.yaml configuration file determines 
which Nodes the new Node should contact to learn about the Cluster and establish 
the GOSSIP process.
