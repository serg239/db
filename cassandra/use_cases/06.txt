Shutdown of a Single Regular Node of an existing Cassandra Cluster
==================================================================

Description
-----------
User stops a Single Regular Node in the existing Cassandra Database Cluster 
by using a Salt state script or predefined scenario (manually).

Assumptions
-----------
1. Regular Node is not the last Node in the existing Cassandra Cluster.

Pre-conditions
--------------
1. The Regular Node is up and running.
2. The IP address of Regular Node is defined in the "shutdown_node" pillar.

Post-conditions
---------------
1. The cassandra process is stopped on Regular Node.

Main Success Scenario
---------------------
1. User runs the shutdown_node.sls Salt state script.
2. The system stops the Cassandra Java server process.

Extensions
----------
1. The Salt state script has not started:
1.1. Check if salt-minion process has been started on the Regular Node.

2. If Cassandra has not stopped:
2.1. Stop the Regular Node manually:
  $ sudo service cassandra stop

Notes:
------
1. The cassandra service runs as a Cassandra Java server process.
2. You must have root or sudo permissions to stop Cassandra as a service.
3. The service runs as the <cassandra_user> user.
4. Startup scripts are provided in /etc/init.d file.
