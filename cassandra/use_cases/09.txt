Deployment of a Cassandra Cluster to be a backup of an Operational Cluster (mirror)
===================================================================================

Description
-----------
Steps to add a Data Center to a Cassandra Cluster, such as when adding capacity 
to an existing Cluster or creating a setup when cassandra streams data to the 
backup cluster as it's added.
User adds a new Data Center to an existing Cassandra Database Cluster by using 
a Salt state script or predefined scenario (manually).

Assumptions
-----------
1. The Cassandra Cluster is up and running.
2. The Nodes of new Data Center are created but not started.

Pre-conditions
--------------
1. The IP addresses and other configuration parameters is defined 
   in the "add_data_center" pillar.
2. The client application does not autodetect the Nodes of the new Data Center 
   so that they aren't contacted by the client until explicitly directed.

Post-conditions
---------------
1. The new Data Center is added to the existing Cassandra Cluster.

Main Success Scenario
---------------------
1. User runs the add_data_center.sls Salt state script.
2. System updates the cassandra.yaml configuration file on EACH Node 
   of the new Data Center
3. System, in case of using PropertyFileSnitch, updates the 
   cassandra-topology.properties configuration file on ALL Nodes 
   to include a new Nodes.
4. System defines if using a QUORUM consistency level for reads or writes, 
   and checks the LOCAL_QUORUM or EACH_QUORUM consistency level to see 
   if the level meets the requirements for multiple Data Centers.
5. System starts the Cassandra process on ALL Seed Node(s) 
   of the new Data Center.
6. System starts the Cassandra process on ALL Regular Node(s) 
   of the new Data Center.
7. System changes the strategy_options for <ks_name> Keyspace 
   to the desired replication factor (defined in the pillar) 
   for the new Data Center.
8. System runs the "nodetool rebuild" command on EACH Node 
   in the new Data Center.

Notes [cassandra.yaml]
----------------------
1. seed lists: 
   EVERY Node in the Cluster must have the same list of Seeds 
   and include at least one node from each Data Center. 
   Typically one to three Seeds are used per Data Center.
2. The NetworkTopologyStrategy is used for <ks_name> and other 
   custom Keyspaces.

Notes [strategy_options]
------------------------
1. Increasing the replication factor increases the total number of copies 
   of each row of data. System updates the number of replicas by updating 
   the strategy_options of the keyspace.

Extensions
----------
1. The Salt state script has not started:
1.1. Check if salt-minion process has been started on all nodes 
     on the new Data Center.
