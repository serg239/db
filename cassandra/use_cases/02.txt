Shutting down the Cassandra Cluster
===================================

Description
-----------
User stops a Cassandra Database Cluster by using a Salt state script 
or predefined scenario (manually).

Assumptions
-----------
1. Cassandra Database Cluster is up and running.

Pre-conditions
--------------
1. The <cluster_name> Service has stopped the data insertion into Cassandra Database.

Post-conditions
---------------
1. The Cassandra Cluster has stopped, i.e. all cassandra processes has stopped 
on ALL Cluster Nodes.

Main Success Scenario
---------------------
1.User runs the "stop_stack.sls" Salt state script.
2.System flashes the data from memory caches to data files.
3.System stops the Cassandra process on Regular Node(s).
4.System stops the Cassandra process on Seed Node(s).

Extensions
----------

1. The Salt state script was not started:
1.1. Check if salt-minion process has been started on all Cluster Nodes.

2. The data has not been flashed from caches to data files.
2.1. Wait about 2 min till the process end.
2.2. Flash the data manually from CLI.

3. The process on Regular Nodes has not been stopped.
3.1. Stop the cassandra process on Regular Nodes manually from CLI, 
     one at a time, and wait about 2 min. after that.

4. The process on Seed Nodes has not been stopped.
4.1. Stop the cassandra process on Seed Nodes manually from CLI, 
     one at a time.
